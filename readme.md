-   users can add or change their bio.

When users click on another user, they can visit the profile and send a friend request, accept a request or delete the friendship.

If the other user is a friend, the users will be able to see the bio and the wall. They will as well be able to post something on the wall.

Under **my friends** users can see their friends and friendship requests. If they receive a new friendship request, they will see a notification with the number of new requests in the navigation bar.
